I'm excited to announce TextSage 1.1, bringing major improvements to the extension based on early feedback from friends (Thanks Dea and Meenal)!

## What's New in 1.1

### New Features
* **Grok Integration**: Added X's Grok AI as a new fact-checking option. Since Twitter often has more current information, this is particularly great for factchecking new information. Additionally, you don't need to login at all â€” so Elon doesn't get your data (as least not personally linked data).
* **Prompt Updates**: Simplified prompts for clear explanations and thorough fact-checking. Meenal found "Explain Like I'm Five" explains things really like I'm five. So, I've updated the prompt to be more focussed on clarity rather than simplicity.
### Website Updates
* Launched our new website at [textsage.netlify.app](https://textsage.netlify.app)
* Release notes will be updated as per new updates. 
## What's Next
Dea suggested that we should be able to factcheck the images or explain the images as well. I'm trying to think how to achieve that as that's not as simple as passing the text through the URL. It would probably require me to download the image and still how would it go to the model? If anyone has any ideas, do let me know!
