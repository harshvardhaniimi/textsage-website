This is Version 1.0 of this Chrome extension. Currently, it supports ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) with ChatGPT and Claude, and factchecking with Perplexity. I'm currently taking feedback on what else to include and if there is a better way to organize this.

We also have a [website](https://timely-speculoos-7541eb.netlify.app/).
